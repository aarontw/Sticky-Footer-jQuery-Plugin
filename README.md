[Heyday Labs](http://labs.heyday.co.nz/) - Sticky Footer jQuery Plugin
================================

Huh? What is it?
----------------

This is a jQuery plugin to create a sticky, collapsible footer.

*Features:*

1. The footer will only anchor itself to the bottom of the window when the hight of the content is greater than that of the window.
2. The footer will self expand (open) as the user scrolls to teh bottom of the page.
3. There are configurable callbacks to change the active, inactive, open and closed states of the toggle.
4. Supported by all modern browsers (IE6 is not a modern browser ;))

Take a look at it in action here: [Down to the Wire](http://downtothewire.co.nz/the-beginning-1989/)

It ain't perfect...
-------------------

Umm - no known issues.
